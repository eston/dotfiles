h2. Development Configuration

This is a repository of my current UNIX/Linux vim/screen development configuration made to make 
my life easier when changing my dev setup on various machines. Feel free to use my same environment 
if you feel that it's useful for you.

This repository exists mostly for my own good, so use at your own risk. No support is provided.
